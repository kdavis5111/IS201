                        <p>See that picture up there? That was the last place I visited on vacation: the beautiful country of Ireland. This was my first time visiting Europe, and I couldn't believe just how much I fell in love with the people, the food, and the sights.
                            The more I travel, the more I realize that my perspective of life is soooo narrow. The Irish people were some of the kindest and most hospitable people I have ever met. They are humble, hardworking, and strong.
                        </p>
                        <p>Saint Augustine says we should travel, but I think we should do more than that. We need experiences with new cultures, new foods, new peoples, and new beliefs. Travel is the first step, but the end goal is to grow in our love for others. I believe
                            that if we can do this, the world will be a better place. We will become more compassionate, tolerant, and understanding.
                        </p>
                        <p>Traveling is one of my favorite hobbies. It is the most valuable way I feel like I can spend my time. But I think that it is essential to know that we don't need to travel far in order to become more compassionate. There are many people that we already know
                            who need the love that we have to give. And we have so much to learn from them. In this sense, "travel" is more of a state of mind.
                        </p>
                        <p>My next stop will be this winter in Washington DC! I can't wait to experience new things, meet new people, and grow as an individual. I am excited to learn more about this wonderful nation and the values that have made it a powerful force for good since 1776!</p>
                        <p>Where will you travel next?</p>
